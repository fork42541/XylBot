##Installation

On CentOS 7, you need a little prep.

  `sudo yum update`
  `sudo yum install perl perl-CPAN gcc`
  `sudo cpan` (Let it run through the first-run process, you can take all defaults.)
  `sudo cpan install String::Similarity`

You may also need to:

  `sudo cpan install File::Read`

At that point you should edit the CONFIG file and edit the details for your installation.
